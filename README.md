# Astropath

Astropath will be a streamlined, user-friendly astrophotography tool designed to simplify the creation of star trails and starlapses. By April 2025, our goal is to deliver an application that enables users to batch import TIFF images, quickly select and deselect images for processing, and apply automated processing modes like gap filling, lighten, and darken to produce clean star trail effects.

Essential features will include a Lightroom-style interface for easy image selection, basic batch import functionality focused on TIFF files, and preset options for users to save and quickly access their preferred processing configurations. Astropath will also include a basic starlapse creation feature, allowing users to convert sequences of night-sky images into time-lapse videos. This version will emphasize efficient workflows for astrophotographers, allowing them to create polished visual effects with minimal manual intervention and without the need for additional tools.
