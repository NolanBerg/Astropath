# Astropath | Status report #2
## Recap
During the last 3 weeks, we have been very productive. We have met with our advisor 2 times and we have set up all of the needed dependencies on our computers to start working on the project.

## Tasks Completed

- We met with our project advisor Ruben, who advised us on how to move forward. He was able to give us insight into what our timeline should look like and encouraged us to start working on our project

- We all downloaded the required dependencies and created a "Hello World" app using Wails/Go. Luckily, Tyler has a lot of experience with this and was able to guide us through it.
- 
## Success
Our biggest success was that we were all able to use Go/Wales and practice/get familiar with the language and framework.

## Roadblocks 
Time is our biggest roadblock. We all have busy schedules, so finding time to meet with each other and our advisor became increasingly hard as classes got more intense.

## Changes & Deviations
We have made no major changes since out last update.

## Confidence = 4

We are ALL confident that we will be able to meet the MVP of the project which we are aiming for plus some. The features we want to achieve in Astropath are a mix of those from other apps which should make this more possible to impliment. However, like we mentoned with the stacking problem, some algorithms are not as clear and simple to implement as others. Trails and starlapse functionality will be completed by the end of senior design along with the workflows and similar features, however it will remain to be seen if we can incorporate the remaining features of if we will need to scrap them.

Overall, Ruben and our group as a whole is excited for the project and to get started with coding soon!

## Group Dynamics

We are working great!
