just need to make a few tweaks to make app
function better.

## Success

Our team made significant strides this past month, successfully implementing key features like Workflow editing/selection, timelapse progress, and presentation progress. We have spent a significant amount of time testing and getting the app presentable and usable. This has been helpful in our noble quest to find and fix bugs. 

## Roadblocks
Not to many roadblocks at this point, have experienced few errors so far. Our biggest issue is that we have found a bug that has the potential to crash a computer when we try to display all of the images on our sequencing page, this will be fixed this week when we implement lazy loading. Overall, nothing too concerning.

## Changes & Deviations
We have made no major changes to our plan since the last update.

## Confidence
- Tyler - 5
-  Nolan - 5
-  Greg - 5
-  Average - 5


## Group Dynamics
We are working well as a group and there are no major issues. The biggest challenge is finding time that fits all of our schedules and time to meet with Reuben.
