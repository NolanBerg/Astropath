## Success

Our team made significant strides this past month, successfully implementing key features like settings reset functionality and error reporting. We streamlined our workflow with batch processing improvements and file type checks, and achieved the ability to process images within the app. 

## Roadblocks
Not to many roadblocks at this point, have few errors so far. Have to create ui for processing as we have just finished the functionality. Make sure toast error reporting is consistent throughout app. Make sure we dont forget any of the little things a normal user would find not functional or unusal. Overall, nothing concerning.

## Changes & Deviations
We have made no major changes to our plan since the last update.

## Confidence
- Tyler - 5
-  Nolan - 5
-  Greg - 5
-  Average - 5


## Group Dynamics
We are working well as a group and there are nomajor issues. The biggest challenge is finding time that fits all of our schedules and time to meet with Reuben.
