## Success

Our team made significant strides this past month, successfully reaching all our major features with only having one stretch goal not met. We are all happy with how the app is currently.

## Roadblocks
Not to many roadblocks at this point, the only real "bug" we have left is the absence of seeing previews of images on windows OS when running the app (the app still works on windows and can generate star trails however you can not preview the images in sequencing page). We know the problem but have not got to fixing it just yet. 

## Changes & Deviations
We have made no major changes to our plan since the last update.

## Confidence
- Tyler - 5
-  Nolan - 5
-  Greg - 5
-  Average - 5


## Group Dynamics
We are working well as a group and there are no major issues. The biggest challenge is finding time that fits all of our schedules and time to meet with Reuben.
