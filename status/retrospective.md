## Group Structure

1) What went well?
Overall everything went very well as a team. We met with each other and our advisor regularly and we were able to get a good feel for what our project is going to look like. We work well together and divide tasks evenly so far. We have all gotten our coding environments set up rather smoothly so that we are ready to hit the ground running over break and next semester to make progress on the project.

2) What didn't go so well?
The hardest part for our team was finding times to meet that fit our individual schedules. We also had to change our initial plan a touch because of the difficulty of stacking long term exposures. 

3) What have we learned?
We have learned that working as a team can be difficult to organize. We have also learned the amount of work that goes into planning and determining the scope of a project. Greg and Nolan have learned a lot from Tyler about astrophotography and camera files that we will have to be dealing with.

3) What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
Our biggest puzzles going forward will be getting real time progress to be shown during the image processing phase. Another problem or puzzle is figuring out if the star stacking is a possibility in the time we have given to finish the project.

## Class Structure

1) What went well and worked and should be continued?
We like how independent the class is. It works well to give us time to work as a group. The occasional standups are very useful for accountability. The classes that are used for standups are useful to gauge where other teams are at in the process. This helps us stay on track with our own project.

2) What didn't go so well and should be changed?
On the same note, given how loosely the class is structured, it is sometimes difficult to remember when we have class and what we have been working on for the class.
