# Astropath | Status report #1
## Recap
During the 3 weeks we established a good means of communication, met with out advisor and completed the **Advisor Authoriation Form**, aswell as decided on project specific implimentation details.

## Tasks Completed

- We met with our project advisor Ruben, who advised us on how to move forward. He was able to give us insight into how Senior Design is typically structured, which helped us decide on what to work on.
    -> (Completed by all of us by meeting with last week)

- Created a **Trello** organizationional board for communication and collaberation. This will allow us to share ideas and see the status of features during the project's lifecycle. In this Trello board, we had a few discussions on what language(s), frameworks, and toolings would best suite our needs for the project and what features we want in the application. 
    -> (Completed by ALL of us in discussion style format)

- Language and Tools. We have mostly decided on using Go and Wails for the Desktop application development and using Svelte & Typescrite for the frontend compontent of the UI. 

- Advisor Authorization Form
    - Signed by all of us
    - Greg reminded us all :) (Go greg!)

## Success
Coming to an agreement on a language, framework and tooling I think is a huge win. Everyone in the group likes diferent things, so I think this is a good thing. The only thing that did not work was meeting times as we all have very diferent schedules and that is something that we will have to work on improving our availability in the future.

## Roadblocks 
When first planned, we wanted to have the ability to stack many images together to create denoise image stacking for milky way images. However, Ruben brought to our attention one issue we will likely run into, which is that with extremely long expure stacks this will be an issue. For shorter stacks this should still be possible, but longer ones this may be alot more complicated then we thought as we need stars are reference points to stack acurately.

## Changes & Deviations
Currently, The scope of the application is to include the image stacking functionality, however Ruben mentioned that for long exposure stacking (~60) minutes for example, this could be something which may not work as expected or be complete. It may be worth noting that other applications have this same problem however. 

Originally, We wanted to be able to do longer stacks, but this may not be the case. We will have to see if we can come upo with some solution to this in the future.  

## Confidence = 4

We are ALL confident that we will be able to meet the MVP of the project which we are aiming for plus some. The features we want to achieve in Astropath are a mix of those from other apps which should make this more possible to impliment. However, like we mentoned with the stacking problem, some algorithms are not as clear and simple to implement as others. Trails and starlapse functionality will be completed by the end of senior design along with the workflows and similar features, however it will remain to be seen if we can incorporate the remaining features of if we will need to scrap them.

Overall, Ruben and our group as a whole is excited for the project and to get started with coding soon!

## Group Dynamics

We are working great!
